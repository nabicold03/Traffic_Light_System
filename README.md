# Traffic_Light_System
In this project, I develop a 2-way traffic ligth system with 2 running mode: normal and manual run. <br>
With normal run: the traffic light system runs at default time (5 seconds for red, 3 seconds for green and 2 seconds for yellow). <br>
With manual run: this state allows users to adjust time for each light color but the red time is always equal to the sum of green and yellow. <br>
